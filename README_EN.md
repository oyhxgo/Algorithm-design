# Algorithm-design

## Hello everyone

Welcome to my project

First of all, this warehouse is mainly to store some of my algorithmic ideas and have a deep understanding of an algorithm. In order to better master this algorithm and this skill, I try to consolidate my knowledge by writing or explaining to others. Every code is open source. Please point out that there will be a great reward, this reference is used for the author's self-study and consolidation, for the answer to the question, are out of the author's own understanding or reference to some of the information on the Internet, readers can directly git this warehouse code, but also pay attention to the author's csdn and b station (if there is time, will be part of the code video explanation)

The explanation of the video or article is out of opinion, and does not represent professional knowledge, so if the use of this open source code causes any accidental injury or any other injury and loss, the consequences shall be borne by the user.
